            <p>     My name is Alba Bernal.
            <br/>
                    I'm from Malaga but currently I'm living in Barcelona.
            <br/>
                    I graduated in Fine Arts at the University of Barcelona in 2009 and have attended several Design and Illustration Workshops and a postgraduate degree in Design.
                    Since then I've worked as an illustrator and graphic designer.
                    I've also participated in exhibitions in France, Barcelona and Malaga.
            <br/>       
                    As a designer I've worked from traditional graphic design to specialize in UX/UI in the area of digital product.
                    I love research, doing interviews and surveys, and making high and low fidelity prototypes. 
                    I believe that usability is a philosophy of life that allows you to know and make your environment easier. It's the warmest part of my work and that's why I adore it.
            <br/>        
                    About Illustration, I use traditional techniques and digital techniques, although what I like most is to combine both.
            <br/>         
                    I like living near the sea, French food, the Surrealist movement and of course cats! Which are things that inspire my creative work. 
                    Other things that I like and inspire me are children's books, science, psychology and human behaviour.
            <br/>        
                    All my works are done with love
                    I hope you enjoy it!
            <br/>        
                    Thank you for visiting!:) </p>
